There are lots of bugs we've experienced only during build gameplay, and not in editor time. Well, happens ;D

How to solve ui bug: when you get to the point after the first run, there will be displayed post-game screen - click Ok, then click Play button and Ok again, and then Play button again :) enjoy 

no more budget for patches
